# misc
Random stuff -- small demos/tutorials, etc.

These are for the Arty A7 35T board:
* `tutorial_0` : plug in the board and play with the built-in demo
* `tutorial_1` : communicate with the board, still using the built-in demo
* `tutorial_2` : programming the board with a new bitstream, then reloading the built-in demo from flash memory
* `buttons` : ignore
